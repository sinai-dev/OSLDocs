### Getting Started

* [How To Install](Main/Installation)

SideLoader supports both C# and non-C# approaches to mod development, so no knowledge of programming is necessary (although it does help!).

A recommend starting point is the [Overview](Basics/Overview) article, or following along with the articles in the <b>Guides</b> category.
