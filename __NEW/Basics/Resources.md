# Resources

These resources are useful tools for developing mods for Outward.

## Outward Tools Sheet
The [Outward Tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1btxPTmgeRqjhqC5dwpPXWd49-_tX_OVLN1Uvwv525K4/edit#gid=673914692) sheet contains lots of datamined information about Outward including Item IDs, Tags, Status Identifiers, etc. It has just about everything you would need for these sorts of things.

## SideLoader Resources
The [SideLoader Resources](https://github.com/sinai-dev/Outward-SideLoader/tree/master/Resources) folder in the SideLoader repo contains some useful files such as blank icons and the `Human_v` bone rig for player characters.

## WIP

Got an idea for something that should be here? Let Sinai know in the Discord.
