# SL Menu

The <b>SideLoader Menu</b> can be used for generating Templates from existing Items, Status Effects and Enchantment recipes, and has a few other various helpers.

## Using The Menu

Open your in-game keybindings and set a binding for the SideLoader Menu. 

Press the button and the menu should open. If it does not, you may have installed SideLoader incorrectly, or you may have conflicting mods installed. Contact Sinai if you can't figure it out.

* To delete something from an SL Pack, you need to manually delete the XML file. By default, new packs are created to `Mods\SideLoader\...`.
* Please refer to the API pages to understand what each value does on the template.
